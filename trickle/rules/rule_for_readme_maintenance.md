# Rule for README Maintenance

When making any significant updates to the Food Maps project:

- Always check if the `trickle/notes/README.md` needs to be updated
- Update the README when adding new features, changing project structure, or modifying setup instructions
- Keep the "Current Status" section up to date with completed and in-development features
- Update the "Last updated" timestamp at the bottom of the README
- Ensure all new components, utilities, or pages are documented in the project structure section
- Update impact metrics when real data becomes available
- Maintain consistency between the README and actual implemented features
