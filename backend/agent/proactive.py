"""
Proactive Suggestion Engine
============================

Generates context-aware suggestions to help users take action.

Suggestion types:
- Reminders: Unclaimed pickups approaching deadline
- Opportunities: New food matching user preferences
- Tips: Profile completion, app features
- Milestones: Impact achievements (50 meals shared!)

Cooldown logic prevents spam (max 1 suggestion per session).
